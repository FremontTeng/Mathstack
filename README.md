# Mathstack
A CZ3003 Project

## Mission Statement
Our game creates a platform for teaching and learning.
Students will enhance their knowledge through playing the game and have more fun competing with each other. Teachers will be able to assess the mastery of the course based on studentsâ€™ playing history. 

Our goal is to bridge the gap between Playing and Learning.

## Normal Mode
Tests users on the mastery of subjects. Includes three difficulty levels, character unlocks and more!

## Challenge Mode
Tests users in a competitive element. Users get health points and try to race to the top in the shortest amount of time. Includes selectable characters, powers and boss fights! Scores will be included in a leaderboard.

## Custom Mode
Create your own custom quiz or play against your friends! Create any quiz of your desire and share with your friends.
